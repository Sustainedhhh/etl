## etl

Project to implement ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) concept with JAVA The idea in a simple way, we want to create processes which allow multiple sub-processes with input (database query, SOAP webservice, RESTful webservice, CSV file or flat files)

## Test

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!--Sample XML file generated by XMLSpy v2008 (http://www.altova.com) -->
<ETL xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="../xsd/ETL.xsd"
	xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
	<Declartion>
		<Connections>
			<Connection url="jdbc:sqlite:./Test/ETL.db" id="etl" username=""
				password="" driver="org.sqlite.JDBC" />
		</Connections>
	</Declartion>
	<Process id="proc1">
		<RESTfulWebservice id="r1">
			<URL>http://localhost:8080/Company/api/Employee</URL>
			<Method>GET</Method>
			<Process id="proc1-child1">
				<Database id="d1" connection-id="etl">
					<sql>INSERT INTO Employee(EMP_ID, NAME) VALUES(?r1./Employees/Employee/ID, '?r1./Employees/Employee/Name')</sql>
				</Database>
			</Process>
		</RESTfulWebservice>
	</Process>
</ETL>
